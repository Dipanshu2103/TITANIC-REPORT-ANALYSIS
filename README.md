**This project explores and visualizes the Titanic dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python. The aim is to uncover key insights about the passengers on board the Titanic, focusing on survival rates, demographics, and travel classes.**

**The dataset includes details like:**

-Passenger ID, Name, Sex, Age

-Pclass (ticket class), Fare

-SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard), Parch (parents/children aboard)

-Embarked port, Survival status

**Key Visualizations**
Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to answer the following questions:

- Distribution of passengers by gender

- Survival rate by class and gender

- Age distribution and its impact on survival

- Class-wise embarkation analysis

- Embarkation port vs. survival

- Fare comparison across different classes and embarkation points

**Libraries Used**
-pandas

-numpy

-matplotlib

-seaborn

**Objective**

To present meaningful visual insights that explain survival trends and patterns among passengers.

**Results & Insights**
Some key insights from the analysis include:

-Women had higher survival rates than men.

-Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival.

-Children and families showed interesting survival behavior.

-Embarkation port had a visible correlation with survival and class.
